## What is Machine Learning



## Supervised Learning vs. Unsupervised Learning vs. Reinforcement Learning

신기한게 강화학습을 따로 떼서 설명한다. reward를 키우는 방향으로 학습하니까 확실히 unsupervised learning 도 아닌 것 같다.



강아지를 훈련시키는 것과 비슷하다. 잘 하면 간식을 주고, 잘못하면 혼내는 식으로 학습한다. 



## Traditional Problem Solving vs. Machine Learning



## Machine Learning의 모델

* Machine Learning Model
* Model Training Algorithm
* Model Inference Algorithm



Machine Learning Model: generic program, made specific by data

Model Training Algorithm: make small changes to the model to fit your problem

Model Inference Algorithm: Using a trained model to predict dats



이렇게 세 단계로 생각해 본 적은 없는데, 진짜 training algorithm도 엄청 중요할 것 같다.

## Steps of machine learning

![steps_of_ml]() #nlp 폴더 안에 있음


<br>
## Step 1: Define the Problem

* 자세하게 정의하기
* 어떤 ML Task인지 생각해보기 : Supervised vs. Unsupervised


<br>
## Step 2: Build a Dataset

데이터 분석의 80%는 데이터셋을 준비하는 과정

* 데이터셋 구축의 단계들: Data Collection, Data Inspection, Summary Statistics, Data Visualization

* Data Inspection: outliers, Missing or incomplete data, Transform your dataset

* Summary Statistics을 통해 Trends in the data, Scale of the data, Shape of the data를 알 수 있다.

  <br>

## Step 3: Model Training

* Splitting Dataset: 훈련 전에 train dataset, test dataset으로 데이터셋을 나눠야 함

* Model training algorithm이 하는 일: Iteratively update **model parameters** to minimize loss function

* model parameters: 모델이 어떻게 작동하는지를 정의함

* Loss Function: 모델이 목표와 얼마나 가깝게 예측하는지를 측정

* 그 외...: hyperparameters 설정, Be prepared to iterate(model training은 정확한 과학이라기 보다는 시행착오를 통해 답을 찾아가는 과정)

<br>

## Step 4: Model Evaluation

* 평가지표를 통해서 모델이 제대로 만들어졌는지를 평가하는 단계.

* 모델이 제대로 만들어지지 않았다면 다시 그 전단계들로 돌아가서 수정한다.

* 대표적인 평가지표: Accuracy, F1 score, Log Loss, Precision, Mean Absolute Error

  There are several metrics to measure linear regression models' performance.  To list a few, MSE, MAE, R square, Adjusted R Square are frequently used methods to evaluate linear regression output. If the dataset that you are using contains many outliers, you might want to use MSE because it penalizes outliers by squaring them. On the other hand, MAE is more suitable for the dataset that has fewer outliers. Lastly, there is R square which evaluates model performance by explainability of predicted values. It is different from MSE or MAE as its score is bound between 0 to 1 and higher score means the better explainability of the model. As R square measures model by variance it is less affected by the data scale than MSE or MAE. Adjusted R square is used when dataset has many features because with more features, R square automatically increases. It is better to use Adjusted R Square when you are doing multi-variate regression.
  
* Mean absolute error (MAE): This is measured by taking the average of the absolute difference between the actual values and the predictions. Ideally, this difference is minimal.

* Root mean square error (RMSE): This is similar MAE, but takes a slightly modified approach so values with large error receive a higher penalty. RMSE takes the square root of the average squared difference between the prediction and the actual value.

* Coefficient of determination or R-squared (R^2): This measures how well-observed outcomes are actually predicted by the model, based on the proportion of total variation of outcomes.

## Case study

### 1. House price prediction

1) Define the Problem

2) Building a Dataset: Data collection, Data exploration, Data cleaning, Data visualization

3) Model Training 

A linear model across a single input variable can be represented as a line. It becomes a plane for two variables, and then a hyperplane for more than two variables. The intuition, as a line with a constant slope, doesn't change.

4) Evaluation

RMSE

5) Inference

Many real word problems are not solvable by a linear models. These problems are usually more complex and require more data as they cannot be fit into single line. One example of non-linear problem can be found in XOR problems. XOR problem(exclusive OR) is a problem that takes two inputs and returns true only when input1 and input2 are exclusive. For instance, you are trying to use umbrella in rainy day. If you use it indoor, it is false; you go out without umbrella ― also false, but if you use umbrella outside than you get the true. Also, problems based on unstructured data like images are hard to solve linearly.



## Case 2 : Book Genre Exploration

book description -> model -> cluster label



ex) K-Means

* **Evaluation metrics:** V-measure, Silhouette coefficient, Rand index, Mutual information, Completeness, Contingency Matrix, Fowlkes-Mallows, Homogeneity, Calinski-Harabasz index, Davies-Bouldin index, Pair confusion matrix

* Silhouette coefficient: k를 늘릴 수록 얼마나 올라가는지 확인해서 급격히 올라갈 때의 K 선정



# Glossary





**Bag of words**: A technique used to extract features from the text. It counts how many times a word appears in a document (corpus), and then transforms that information into a dataset.

A **categorical** label has a discrete set of possible values, such as "is a cat" and "is not a cat."

**Clustering**. Unsupervised learning task that helps to determine if there are any naturally occurring groupings in the data.

**CNN**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) represent nested filters over grid-organized data. They are by far the most commonly used type of model when processing images.

A **continuous (regression)** label does not have a discrete set of possible values, which means possibly an unlimited number of possibilities.

**Data vectorization**: A process that converts non-numeric data into a numerical format so that it can be used by a machine learning model.

**Discrete**: A term taken from statistics referring to an outcome taking on only a finite number of values (such as days of the week).

**FFNN**: The most straightforward way of structuring a neural network, the Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) structures neurons in a series of layers, with each neuron in a layer containing weights to all neurons in the previous layer.

**Hyperparameters** are settings on the model which are not changed during training but can affect how quickly or how reliably the model trains, such as the number of clusters the model should identify.

**Log loss** is used to calculate how uncertain your model is about the predictions it is generating.

**Hyperplane**: A mathematical term for a surface that contains more than two planes.

**Impute** is a common term referring to different statistical tools which can be used to calculate missing values from your dataset.

**label** refers to data that already contains the solution.

**loss function** is used to codify the model’s distance from this goal

**Machine learning**, or ML, is a modern software development technique that enables computers to solve problems by using examples of real-world data.

**Model accuracy** is the fraction of predictions a model gets right. Discrete: A term taken from statistics referring to an outcome taking on only a finite number of values (such as days of the week). Continuous: Floating-point values with an infinite range of possible values. The opposite of categorical or discrete values, which take on a limited number of possible values.

**Model inference** is when the trained model is used to generate predictions.

model is an extremely generic program, made specific by the data used to train it.

**Model parameters** are settings or configurations the training algorithm can update to change how the model behaves.

**Model training algorithms** work through an interactive process where the current model iteration is analyzed to determine what changes can be made to get closer to the goal. Those changes are made and the iteration continues until the model is evaluated to meet the goals.

**Neural networks**: a collection of very simple models connected together. These simple models are called **neurons**. The connections between these models are trainable model parameters called **weights**.

**Outliers** are data points that are significantly different from others in the same sample.

**Plane**: A mathematical term for a flat surface (like a piece of paper) on which two points can be joined by a straight line.

**Regression**: A common task in supervised machine learning.

In **reinforcement learning**, the algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal.

**RNN/LSTM**: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and the related Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model types are structured to effectively represent for loops in traditional computing, collecting state while iterating over some object. They can be used for processing sequences of data.

**Silhouette coefficien**t: A score from -1 to 1 describing the clusters found during modeling. A score near zero indicates overlapping clusters, and scores less than zero indicate data points assigned to incorrect clusters. A

**Stop words**: A list of words removed by natural language processing tools when building your dataset. There is no single universal list of stop words used by all-natural language processing tools.

In **supervised learning,** every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it. As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values.

**Test dataset**: The data withheld from the model during training, which is used to test how well your model will generalize to new data.

**Training dataset**: The data on which the model will be trained. Most of your data will be here.

**Transformer**: A more modern replacement for RNN/LSTMs, the transformer architecture enables training over larger datasets involving sequences of data.

In **unlabeled data**, you don't need to provide the model with any kind of label or solution while the model is being trained.

In **unsupervised learning**, there are no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data.
